## About me
As a current Master's student in Artificial Intelligence, I have developed a strong academic foundation in Machine Learning and Data Science, driven by a deep interest in applying these fields to solve real-world problems. Throughout my academic career, I have consequently aligned my studies with my professional aspirations in Data Science, seeking out opportunities to build expertise in Python, SQL, and Machine Learning modeling techniques. This focus has allowed me to transform complex datasets into actionable insights and gain hands-on experience in projects that bridge theory with practical applications. Letâ€™s connect and explore how we can drive impact through data-driven solutions!
